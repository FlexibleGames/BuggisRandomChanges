# Buggi's Random Changes
A compilation mod for Vintage Story.

## What does it do?
This mod is a big collection of various things I've changed over many hours of play.

I realize not everyone is going to want every change. So the changes are broken up in different files named for their purpose.
Check the files, remove ones you don't want, tweak the values you don't agree with. I encourage everyone to get the most
out of their game and choices of mods.

## What Changes?
- Adds a decorative block that resembles a chain. Made with chain links that are craftable with molds.
- Adds 'Mass' ingot and plate molds. Mass Ingot mold allows you to poor 40 ingots in one shot. Mass plate gives 8 plates.
- Changes metal Nuggets stack size to 400 so a fully loaded Crucible can fill 2 mass ingot molds. Takes a LONG time to melt them down though.
- Adds a Spile mold for Expanded Foods, which I think he nabbed for his mod. Might disable this.
- Adds Craftable Chandeliers in a few metal types. Maxed with candles it is **THE** best light source in the game.
- Adds Metal Fences in a few metal types. Immune to fire and very shiney, makes for great building accents.
- Adds recipes to dupe Chiseled blocks. A little derpy, suggestions on a better system is welcome.
- Made Sand from Gravel using the Pulverizer.
- Tweaks/Adds Nitrogen-based fertilizer recipes.
- Increases Seed output from mature plants and tweaks output from mature plants.
- Adds Titanium Chain Mail Armor for the ultimate protection. A very late game item.
- Adds chain mail mold for aforementioned armor crafting.
- Increases Tool-head stack size to 32 for most tool heads.
- Adds slightly cheaper Metal Block recipe (3x3 ingot). Convert back to ingot with chisel.
- Made Resin from a Barrel using Honey and powdered Borax.
- Mulch Meat and grass into compost in a barrel.

## Other Details

## Github? 
Where's the code? Why is this on GitHub? 

Because it's the best place for backing up the mod, sharing the code, and keeping it up-to-date.

Do not copy or post this mod as your own. It is here to help the community. As well as be available if I ever walk away from Vintage Story modding at any point.
